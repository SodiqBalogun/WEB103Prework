## Notes

* A challenge I encountered while building the app was applying the light/dark mode toggle. When I tried to change the background color of the creator cards to match the current theme (a dark purple for dark mode and a light pink for light mode), I found that the entire app's background was also changing. To fix this, I went back to ensure that the defaults of each background color were consistent.
* I encountered many small hiccups like this across the prework, but they were pretty simple to address overall.
